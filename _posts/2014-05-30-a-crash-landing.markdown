It's been an exciting journey.  We're most excited to announce that Golden Viking officially has a home.  But this is only the beginning.

Over the last month we've been closely working with [reBaked](https://www.rebaked.com) on a new mobile project, [Terror Torch](https://www.rebaked.com/projects/8).  If you're reading this message in the month of May, JOIN THE PROJECT!  This is the first of many experiments that we have in the pipeline.

Stay-tuned.
